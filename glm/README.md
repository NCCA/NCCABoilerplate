# GLM example

This demo show how to use the [glm](https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.9/index.html) library for maths in C++. It is basically a cpu implementation of the GLSL maths library. It is very useful for doing maths in OpenGL and Vulkan applications before passing this data to the GPU. 

It can also be used to replicate a number of function we need for 3D graphics such as lookAt, perspective and orthographic projection matrices.
