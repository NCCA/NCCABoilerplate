# FMT example

This demo uses the fmt library to print out a string. [{fmt}](https://fmt.dev/latest/index.html) is an open-source formatting library providing a fast and safe alternative to C stdio and C++ iostreams.

It is similar to the python print function and is very fast easy to use. 

We install this via vcpkg for now and it can be used either as a header only version or with a pre-compiled library.

C++ 20 will introduce a [formatting library](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/format) but this is not available yet in the compilers we use so this is an easy way to future proof.
