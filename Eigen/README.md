# Eigen example

This is a simple project that shows how to use the [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) library for maths in C++. I only show simple Vector and Matrix operations here, however Eigen is a very powerful library and can do a lot more than this.

In particular if you need to do multi-dimensional arrays then Eigen is a good choice. It also has a lot of optimisations for different platforms and architectures. 

It has a very nice [getting started](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/GettingStarted.html) guide that is worth reading.
