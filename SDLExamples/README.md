# SDL2 Demos

This folder contains a number of SDL2 demos, each demo is in its own subdirectory.

-[PutPixel](./PutPixel/) - This is a simple demo that shows how to draw a pixel to the screen using the SDL2 library.
-[OpenGL](./OpenGL/) - This is a simple demo that shows how to use OpenGL with SDL2. It uses the glm library to setup projection and camera matrices but uses the deprecated OpenGL fixed function pipeline to draw a triangle to the screen.
